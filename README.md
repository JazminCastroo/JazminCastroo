# ~ Hi! ~
I'm *Jazmin Castro :)* 

## *Front-End Programmer* 

I'm a *17 years old* ***front-end*** and a still learning ***Back-End*** web designer. I love web security and i've worked with various projects from secondary school, and I'm very obssesed with the good and cute-looking webs.


My **primary** programming languages are:
1. HTML 🟠
2. CSS 🔵
3. MySQL 🐬

I'm **actually learning** the next Back-End languages:
1. PHP 🟣
2. Java ☕

   Remember that if you were not ready you would not have the opportunity.
